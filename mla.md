Commonly referred to as MLA, this style of documentation employs parenthetical in-text citations which correspond to a works cited page at the end of the document. This guide will teach you how to create works cited page entries and their parenthetical counterparts.

Any sources you quote, summarize, paraphrase, or consult will be included in your works cited page. Sources are listed alphabetically by the authors’ surnames. For each entry, every line after the first line is indented. This is called “hanging indentation.”

For your in-text citations, parentheses containing the information should appear at the end of the sentence, before the period and after quotation marks (if there are any), like so (Lastname 12). The “12” here refers to the page number of the source.

If you are drawing from the same source for most of a paragraph, simply cite the source at the end of the last sentence. This is the general format for a book by a single author:

Lastname, Firstname. *Title of Book*. Publisher, Year of Publication.

## Single-Author Book (again)

Egan, Sophie. *How to Be a Conscious Eater: Making Food Choices That Are Good for You, Others, and the Planet*. Workman Publishing Co, Inc., 2020.

<u>Parenthetical</u>: (Egan 51).

**Note**: if you are citing content from a digital or e-book, indicate it as such:

Silva, Paul J. *How to Write a Lot: A Practical Guide to Productive Academic
Writing*. E-book, American Psychological Association, 2007.

<u>Parenthetical</u>: (Silva 24).

## Multiple Authors for One Book

Ward, Geoffrey C. and Ken Burns. *The War: An Intimate History, 1941-1945*.
Alfred A. Knopf, 2007.

<u>Parenthetical</u>: (Ward and Burns 72).

**Note**: if there are three authors or more, only list the first author’s name followed by et al.—an abbreviation of a Latin phrase meaning “and others.”

<u>Parenthetical</u>: (Ward et al. 72).

## Book with an Author and Editor/Translator/Compiler

García Márquez, Gabriel. *Love in the Time of Cholera*. Translated by Edith Grossman, New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1988.

<u>Parenthetical</u>: (García Márquez 18).

**Note**: if the edition is anything other than the first edition (revised edition, third edition, etc.), its original publication year is noted after the title:

García Márquez, Gabriel. *Love in the Time of Cholera*. 2nd ed., translated by Edith Grossman, New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1988.

## Editor/Translator/Compiler in place of Author

Young, Glenn, editor. *The Best American Short Plays, 2002-2003*. New York: Applause, 2007.

<u>Parenthetical</u>: (Young 93).

**Note**: use this method when referring to material that the named editor/translator wrote, such as a “Translator’s Note.”


## Chapter of a Book or Essay in an Anthology

Harris, Muriel. “Talk to Me: Engaging Reluctant Writers.” *A Tutor’s Guide: Helping Writers One to One*, edited by Ben Rafoth, Heinemann, 2000, pp. 24-34.

<u>Parenthetical</u>: (Harris 27).

**Note**: in the example above, the chapter or essay title appears in quotation marks after the author’s name. The title of the collection in which it appears is in italics. The editor(s) of the collected work should also be noted. The numbers listed after the year are the page range of the whole chapter.

## Introduction, Preface, Foreword, or Afterword

<u>Parenthetical</u>: (Bagchi 45).

**Note**: in the example above, “15” is the volume number and “1” is the issue number. The numbers after the publication year (41-50) are the page range of the entire article.

**Note**: when citing a scholarly article that you accessed online, include the URL and when you accessed it *after* the print edition information:
